The far left corner of the room is
dimly lit by a hundred white handles
waxing out on a hand made rose wood
bedside table.

On the bed is a attractive young woman
reading Ray Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451".

She notices you at the other corner
of the room. She puts the book aside and
with wanton menace slides her
fingers into her vulva, then ushers you to
her with her middle finger and salaciously
licks it.

She lecherously stares at you for sometime
and gets back to her book.
Her fingers back on her clitoral hood.

BTW, she's naked.
