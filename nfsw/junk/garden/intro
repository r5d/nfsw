Abruptly, you're caught in
a swirl of purple, pink, and black.

Then your eyes are smote
by the pleasant sun
and the smell of grass.

"Thud!"

You land face first on a
soft green bed of grass.

You're in a garden.
The sight of red, orange, and
yellow flower arrays
trigger pleasure signals to your
cortex.

It's completely silent except
for the noise from a chipmunk
gnawing an acorn on an oak tree.

In the far end, you see a rundown
building. The front entrance looks open.
