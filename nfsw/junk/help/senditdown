NFSW Help:

 1. In most scenes you'll have to answer a
    question. Simply enter the answer to move to
    the next stage of the game.

 2. If you would like to navigate to some place
    simply type in "enter PLACE" or "go to PLACE".

 3. If you would like to reset the game and start
    from the beginning, type "nfsw reset".

 4. If you see a mirror, touch it! -- like "touch
    mirror".

 5. If you wish to logout of the game any time
    type "nfsw logout".

 6. If you need more help, ping Santa at
    santa@dingy.space

    If you don't seem to get any response from
    Santa, check your spam folder. It's possible
    for your email provider to mark emails from
    Santa as spam.
