NFSW Help:

 1. In most scenes you'll have to answer a
    question. Simply enter the answer to move to
    the next stage of the game.

 2. If you would like to navigate to some place
    simply type in "enter PLACE" or "go to PLACE".

 3. If you would like to reset the game and start
    from the beginning, type "nfsw reset".

 4. If you see a mirror, touch it! -- like "touch
    mirror" or somepin.

 5. Lastly, as Lee Ann Womack aptly put it:

       The deck is stacked against you
       Life's a losing hand
       Even when you think you're up
       You're right back down again
       Either way you play it
       The house is gonna win
