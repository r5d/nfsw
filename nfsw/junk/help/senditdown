NFSW Help:

 1. In most scenes you'll have to answer a
    question. Simply enter the answer to move to
    the next stage of the game.

 2. If you would like to navigate to some place
    simply type in "enter PLACE" or "go to PLACE".

 3. If you would like to reset the game and start
    from the beginning, type "nfsw reset" and then
    "yes".

 4. The whole thing is nihilistic. So, fuck it.
