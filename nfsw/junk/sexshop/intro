It's completely dark.
Feels moist.
And reeks of stale cheese and apple pie.

You realize that you're
Formless, sexless, colorless.
Transparent.
But still in touch with your consicousness.

A stout sensual middle aged nitwit appears.
Out of blue.

He jabbers "Let's make you look human."

Then he winks out of existence.
A large screen appears.
It's light is blinding.

It reads:

    Would you like a male or female body?
