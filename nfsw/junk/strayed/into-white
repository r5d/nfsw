The TVs splinter into a
a billion shards and the room
disintegrates and withers into
the empty stark white.

You enter into a free fall.
You're in the stratosphere.
Plummeting into nowhere at 120mph.
The speed of free fall increasing
every seconds due to laws of space.

Below, you don't see Earth.
Just space. White space, dotted
with white cottons of the ether.
