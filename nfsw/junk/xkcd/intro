Abruptly the free fall comes to a stop
and you float in mid air with your eyes
towards to the cotton specked ether.

The cogs of the clouds move hither and
thither and present you with a question:

"What do the kids in XKCD find out when
they tried to make sex simple?"

You continue to defy the law of gravity
and float in thin air.
